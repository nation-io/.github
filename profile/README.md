# Mission

The status quo favors the few with resources.

The future favors the resources of the many.

We're creating tools for communities to pool resources to propel projects, create micro-enterprises, and purchase assets. Together.

NATION is a new vehicle for collaboration.

Our mission is to evolve online governance models and financial tech into practical community utilities that allow everyday artists, activists, investors, and buliders to make outsized impacts on the world.
